Instructions

Match your layout as close to the screenshot as possible using the CSS properties discussed and also researching MDN for new properties if needed. 

Use the button element to represent each calculator button.

Make use of the special characters to show / , X, -, +, =

In your HTML structure separate the calculator screen and buttons into separate sections.(This will help with the second part of this project)

Keep the wrapper width that is set for you

Make use of hover and active pseudo classes to show different states of button behavior. 

Can use either flexbox or grid layout. Your choice.
